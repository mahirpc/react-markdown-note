# React Markdown Note

This project is done as part of the course in https://scrimba.com/ 

The notes app is hosted using github pages at https://mahirpc.github.io/react-markdown-note/

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````
